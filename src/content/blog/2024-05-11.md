description: Weekly recap of the announcements and activity in the Nix community and on the NixPkgs package repository.
---

Last week began with a bang, starting with the announcement of [Lix](https://lix.systems), a Nix fork. The project
describes itself as "a modern, delicious implementation of the Nix package manager, focused on correctness,
usability, and growth â€“ and committed to doing right by its community" and is run by several [subject matter
experts](https://lix.systems/team/). Lix has been worked on for the past two months before beginning its public
preview on May 5th. With improvements to stability and user experience, this project is worth following. If you
would like to get started using Lix, see the instructions for [Installing Lix](https://lix.systems/install/).

[@thufschmitt](https://discourse.nixos.org/u/thufschmitt) announced that [Nix Constitutional Assembly Applications are now open](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nix-constitutional-assembly-applications-open/45186). For community
members interested in participating in the 7-member assembly, see the announcement post for full details on the
application requirements and instructions. The process is expected to take roughly two weeks of work spread over the
course of two months in order to establish a new governance structure for the Nix ecosystem.

[@Mic92](https://discourse.nixos.org/u/Mic92) has posted a call for help [updating links to point to the new NixOS wiki](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/help-wanted-updating-links-to-point-to-the-new-nixos-wiki/45185).
With the recent adoption of the official NixOS wiki, existing documentation and community resources need to be
modified to point to [wiki.nixos.org](https://wiki.nixos.org). Any help is welcome and will improve the onboarding
experience of new Nix users by making it easier to find official documentation.

[@fricklerhandwerk](https://discourse.nixos.org/u/fricklerhandwerk) announced that regular [documentation office hours and onboarding for new maintainers](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/documentation-office-hours-onboarding-for-new-maintainers/45015) will be held each week for the next few months. If you would like to help improve the state
of Nix documentation, interested contributors can view available office hours on [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=b9o52fobqjak8oq8lfkhg3t0qg@group.calendar.google.com).
