description: Weekly recap of the announcements and activity in the Nix community and on the NixPkgs package repository.
---

This week was a tumultuous one for the Nix community. Concerns were raised for a second time about
the sponsorship of branded Nix events by weapons manufacturers. Many contributors made their stance
clear [in an Open Letter](https://nixos-users-against-mic-sponsorship.github.io/). Additional
discussion took place on the NixOS forums, but it became clear that the NixOS Foundation Board members
and other named members from the Open Letter do not currently believe this sponsorship is an issue despite
the explicit requests of community members to not have their work used to advertise weapons services.
If you have not already, please consider adding your signature to the letter. Thank you to
[@samueldr](https://github.com/samueldr) for creating the Open Letter and thank you to all
of the community members who have signed it so far.

Now, for the rest of the news...

[@edolstra](https://discourse.nixos.org/u/edolstra) announced [the release of Nix 2.21](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nix-2-21-released/41300)!
This release includes improvements for error reporting within `nix repl`, adds support for `--debugger`
sessions to access `let` bindings, and includes new options for the `nix profile upgrade` and
`nix profile remove` commands. All changes in this release are available in [the release notes](https://releases.nixos.org/nix/nix-2.21.0/manual/release-notes/rl-2.21.html).

[@lucperkins](https://discourse.nixos.org/u/lucperkins) shared that [FlakeHub Cache is in private beta](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/introducing-flakehub-cache-private-beta/41382).
FlakeHub Cache brings Flake-level caching to FlakeHub, all private and managed with JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for
authentication. Pushing to the cache is currently available in GitHub Actions and GitLab support is coming soon.
Determinate Systems is currently looking for feedback and encourage folks to sign up for the beta and ask any
questions in [the company's Discord](https://discord.gg/rCNfASmmre).

[@shivaraj-bh](https://discourse.nixos.org/u/shivaraj-bh) has announced
[services-flake](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/announcing-services-flake/41338), a new project to provide portable
services that work on both Linux and macOS using Nix Flakes. This is an ambitious goal and could use all
of the help the community can deliver. If you are interested in contributing,
you can find the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/juspay/services-flake).

[@aanderse](https://discourse.nixos.org/u/aanderse) announced the release of [teraflops](https://github.com/juspay/services-flake), a tool that @aanderse has used to replace [NixOps](https://github.com/NixOS/nixops). Teraflops
combines `colmena`, `terraform`, and `nixos-infect` to enable system deployment and management using Nix Flakes.
The project is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/aanderse/teraflops).

[@Freed-Wu](https://discourse.nixos.org/u/Freed-Wu) published
[a port of `vscode-ide-nix` to Vim](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/port-vscode-ide-nix-to-vim-by-coc-nvim/41364).
This port provides Vim users with the same set of tools that VS Code users have been using to develop with Nix.
For a full set of instructions on how to start using the plugin, see the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Freed-Wu/coc-nix).
