This week the Nix community saw a new deployment tool, the beginning of a rework for the NixOS website, discussion of budgeting for community teams, and several useful updates to NixPkgs.

[@thufschmitt](https://discourse.nixos.org/u/thufschmitt) posted [an announcement](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/community-teams-budget/40307)
following up on [last month's team members meeting](https://github.com/NixOS/teams-collaboration/blob/78fe3afa7ae700da476c9780529b389cf12b0c30/meeting-notes/2024-01-11.md#team-funding-scheme) which raised the question of funding for teams. While it is
appreciated that so many members of the community have dedicated time, effort, and finances to running
certain projects, moving forward at least some of this work can and should be funded by the NixOS Foundation.
To this end, [established teams](https://nixos.org/community/#governance-teams) will be allocated an initial budget of 100â‚¬/month. This should help alleviate some strain and allow important parts of NixOS infrastructure to be
better delegated to responsible individuals.

[@avocadoom](https://discourse.nixos.org/u/avocadoom) announced the beginning of a [NixOS website rework](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/announcing-phase-1-of-the-nix-os-website-rework/40473)!
The announcement covers some of the current pain points felt from the technology and UI/UX of the current
site. Moving forward, there are three distinct phases that the project will follow: migrate to [Astro](https://astro.build/), improve UX and fix accessibility issues, and finally to modernize the look and feel of the site. A
[beta version](https://main--nixos-homepage.netlify.app/) is available for testing this first phase of changes and
bug reports are welcome [on GitHub](https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-homepage/issues/new/choose). If you're interested in
contributing to the project, the team is coordinating on the [marketing Matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#marketing:nixos.org).

[@lewo](https://discourse.nixos.org/u/lewo) released [Comin](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/comin-git-push-nixos-machines/40688), a pull-oriented
deployment tool intended to bring GitOps to NixOS system management. Configured systems will poll remotes for new
configuration and rebuild to reflect the changes. Comin also provides some useful features like testing branches
to see if changes work correctly, polling multiple remotes, and machine migrations. The project can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/nlewo/comin).
