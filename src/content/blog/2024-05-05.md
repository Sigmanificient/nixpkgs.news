As of last week, Eelco Dolstra has stepped down from the NixOS Foundation Board. The foundation outlined steps for and began organizing a constitutional assembly to restructure governance for the Nix ecosystem.
The board intends to delegate authority to the community to during and after this restructuring effort.
As such, a discussion space has been created on Zulip with the goals of managing this assembly and receiving
input from members of the community. For the full details of these events and for information on how to
join the assembly discussion space, see the official post: [NixOS Foundation Board: Giving power to the
community](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nixos-foundation-board-giving-power-to-the-community/44552).

[@BatteredBunny](https://discourse.nixos.org/u/BatteredBunny) has announced [Brew-nix](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/brew-nix-a-flake-automatically-packaging-all-homebrew-casks/44880),
an experimental Nix flake for automatically packaging all Homebrew casks for Nix. If you are currently
using Nix on macOS and would like to transition any remaining Homebrew tooling to reproducible Nix
configuration then this project is just the one for you. The project can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/BatteredBunny/brew-nix).

[@viperML](https://discourse.nixos.org/u/viperML) released [Noshell](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/noshell-user-configurable-login-shell/44703), a user-configurable login shell that allows for switching shells
without root privileges. Users can replace their shell by modifying a symlink in their home directory rather
interfacing with `chsh` or system configuration. For more information, see the project's [GitHub](https://github.com/viperML/noshell) repository.

[@Mic92](https://discourse.nixos.org/u/Mic92) let the community know that [Buildbot-nix now supports Gitea](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/buildbot-nix-now-supports-gitea/44789).
Documentation for the feature is still in progress, but users can begin using it today by referencing
examples in the project's [GitHub](https://github.com/Mic92/buildbot-nix/blob/a36953b52d6bb9a52da2f5edce9abba18bd595c5/examples/master.nix#L41) repository.

[@RaitoBezarius](https://discourse.nixos.org/u/RaitoBezarius) announced a partnership between
[Framework and the NixOS Community](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/exciting-partnership-announcement-framework-community-nixos-communities-join-forces/44640)!
The partnership intends to seed Framework computers to participants who will be able to contribute fixes
and improvements for NixOS support on these machines. For information on how to apply, see the linked
announcement.

[@binarycat](https://discourse.nixos.org/u/binarycat) has released [Nix-inst](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nix-inst-0-3-3-released-better-imperitive-package-management/44831),
a tool for managing imperative package management more easily. The tool comes with UX, stability, and
performance improvements as well as support for systems using Nix Flakes and ones that are not. The
project can be found on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/binarycat/nix-inst).

[@hexa](https://discourse.nixos.org/u/hexa) welcomed [@endocrimes](https://discourse.nixos.org/u/endocrimes) (Danielle Lancashire) to the moderation team. She has been contributing to NixPkgs since 2019 and co-chairs
the CNCF wasm-wg as well as being a member of the Kubernetes Code of Conduct Committee. Her experience and
and knowledge should make her a great addition to the team. The full announcement is available on the
[NixOS Discourse](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/welcome-endocrimes-to-the-moderation-team/44793).

[@aciceri](https://discourse.nixos.org/u/aciceri) posted [Agenix-shell](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/agenix-shell-keep-secrets-directly-in-your-flake-and-access-them-from-your-devshell/44716),
a tool that allows for encrypted secrets to be provided to flakes while having them decrypted in the
development shell environment. The project's source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/aciceri/agenix-shell).

[@Janik](https://discourse.nixos.org/u/Janik) announced this year's [Google Summer of Code Participants](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/announcing-our-google-summer-of-code-participants/44618)!
These participants include siddhantCodes, Sinan Mohd, Vidhvath J, and Yurii Shymon. Over the next 8-12
weeks pull requests and progress posts will be created as a part of the event. This is the first year that
the NixOS Foundation is participating in Google Summer of Code and it is exciting to see some great
initiatives and contributors joining.
