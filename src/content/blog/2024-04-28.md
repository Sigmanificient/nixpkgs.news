Recent events in the Nix Community have resulted in many unpleasant situations over the last week. Jonathan Ringer will no
longer be fulfilling the role of release manager due to multiple code of conduct violations. NixPkgs maintainers are [leaving
the project](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues?q=label%3A%228.has%3A+maintainer+removal%22+is%3Aclosed). Many of these
events have been percolating, but have since reached [a breaking point](https://kilo.bytesize.xyz/nix-the-breaking-point).
Vital packages are currently left unmaintained and morale is at an all-time low. Currently, the future of Nix appears unclear
and pretending otherwise would be disingenuous. As such, this week's issue of nixpkgs.news is not including announcements or a report of
packages, modules, or security changes. Instead, readers are encouraged to reflect on how we got here and the substantial changes
that must be made to governance of Nix if it is to continue.
